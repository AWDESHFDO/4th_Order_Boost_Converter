In this project, I performed an analysis of a DCâ€“DC Boost Converter by adding an LC filter at the output stage to improve voltage quality and reduce ripple. The modification was implemented to study its effect on output voltage smoothness, efficiency, and Total Harmonic Distortion (THD). The converter was tested and analyzed using MATLAB/Simulink simulations and hardware measurements with a power analyzer and oscilloscope. The results demonstrated that the inclusion of the LC filter significantly reduced output ripple and improved the overall performance of the Boost Converter.
